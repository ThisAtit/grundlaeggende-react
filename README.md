# Example on Semantic Usage in React

In this project, I've create a sample on how to use semantic tags in a react project, in order to make it as easy as possible to implement further semantics later on.

## Tools used in the project

Bootstrap 5.3 (https://getbootstrap.com)
SASS

## React Components Used

ract-router-dom (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
sass (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
